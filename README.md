# Fatal-Police-Shootings-Analysis 

Key Takeaways 

* 1. Relative to the population black people are Fatally shot more often by Police, while White people are less often Fatally shot.

* 2. More people are perceived to be a threat level = Attack when police are not carrying a body camera.
        
        * 2.1 Is the lack of body camera leading to more people than necessary being fatally shot? Where they really a threat?

* 3. A higher percentage of people fatally shot who are of Black decent are younger than people from White decent* 
        
        * 3.1 In hindsight this could/should have been explored more, by filtering the data for ages below 30 or 40 and seeing if that would change any of the outcomes from the analysis.
    
Should have done differently:
* 1. Normalized the data. I should have taken into account the difference in population between states in the US, this would have potentially changed the outcome of the analysis significantly, as some states have a much greater population than others.
